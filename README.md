sw_1L_channel_np2ps_stab.py  
>>Creates A using numpy/scipy then moves rows to petsc4py matrix Could use eig, eigs, or slepc 

sw_1L_channel_ps_fixed.py 
>>A (petsc) built with separate parts, using the other numpy matrices (Dy, dH, etc.) 

sw_1L_channel_np_stab2.py and sw_1L_channel_n_stab.py 
>>basically, just use numpy only. 2 ways of making A (2 is better/faster) 
---sw_1L_channel_np_stab2 uses numpy only .. can choose between eig and eigs. Converted some matrices to be sparse. Builds A for each piece.
---sw_1L_channel_np_stab -- numpy only, eig/eigs, builds matrix by concatenating each part.

sw_1L_channel_ps_newguess.py 
>>petsc only â€“ guess changes to be the previous one just calculated. Still need an initial guess.vvv
